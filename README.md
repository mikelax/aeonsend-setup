# Aeon's End  Set up Wizard

This is a sample project to experiement and play with React and related technologies.
As a recently received my [Kickstarter backed game Aeon's End](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/actionphasegames/aeons-end), I thought I could write a little
web app to automate some of the initial card set up.

This web app helps generate the "Supply", or initial list of cards availabe to upgrade the player deck.
It will also randomly select Mages and a Nemesis based on the indicated number of players and
Expansions to include.

# What is this game?

Aeon's End is a cooperative game that explores the deckbuilding genre with a number of
innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an
attack, and deck management rules that invite careful planning of every discarded card.
Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique
abilities, powerful spells, and, most importantly of all, their collective wits.
